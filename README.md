# os-data-hub

os-data-hub contains examples of code for using [Ordnance Survey Data Hub APIs](https://osdatahub.os.uk/) with [ArcGIS API for Javascript v4](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/).

## What is the OS Data Hub?

The Ordnance Survey Data Hub is a collection of APIs that provide access to a range of Open data and OS Premium data to support developers building apps.

The code samples included in this repo demonstrate how a developer using the ArcGIS API for JavaScript v4 can get started with three of the APIs:

- [OS Maps API](https://osdatahub.os.uk/docs/wmts/overview) - access basemaps via OGC standard WMTS or RESTful ZXY.
- [OS Vector Tile API](https://osdatahub.os.uk/docs/vts/overview) - highly customisable vector tiles.
- [OS Features API](https://osdatahub.os.uk/docs/wfs/overview) - run spatial and attribute queries against a web feature service.

## How to use the samples

To use the APIs in your apps you first need to sign up for the service. Information about how to do this can be found on the [OS Data Hub Plans & Pricing](https://osdatahub.os.uk/plans) page. See the [getting started guide](https://osdatahub.os.uk/docs/wfs/gettingStarted) for more information on setting up an API Project and obtaining a API key for use in your applications.

Each sample contains all the code required to work. You just need to replace the `INSERT_API_KEY_HERE` text with your API key.

## Further resources and examples

The OS Data Hub provides detailed [documentation](https://osdatahub.os.uk/docs) and [examples](https://labs.os.uk/public/os-data-hub-examples/) about all three services.
